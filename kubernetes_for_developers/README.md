# What developers and data scientists should know about Kubernetes

## Abstract

Kubernetes and containers are the building blocks of a modern cloud infrastructure and de-facto the standard for deploying, managing and orchestrating applications at scale.

But for many developers and data scientists ops or devops topics/technologies are just outside their comfort zone.

This talk will introduce you to Kubernetes and modern DevOps, I wonâ€™t cover how to administrate a Kubernetes cluster but I will focus on how to get the most out of it and how to avoid many of the common pitfalls.
