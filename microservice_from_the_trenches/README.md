# Microservices from the trenches

## Abstract

During this presentation I will explain what are micro-services and compare them to monolith applications.

By analysing what are the differences between micro-services and monolith applications I will show why you need them and for which situations they are extremely useful.

I will also talk about what you need on different levels regarding infrastructure, knowledge and experience to get the most out of a micro-services architecture.

The last part of the presentation is dedicated to the drawbacks of running a micro-services architecture and sharing some solutions.

I will conclude sharing some useful resources about micro services and taking some questions.
