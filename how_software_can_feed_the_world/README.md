# How software can feed the World

## Abstract

Infarm is a FaaS, Farming as a Service,  and whether you believe it or not, our business is in-house farming at scale.

We design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the backbone of our infrastructure is based on Python and completely cloud based.

More than 10 million observations recorded from our farms, rapidly increasing given our expansion to new markets, feed  our farm management system that allows the operators, plant scientists, and supervisors to monitor each farm in real-time.

During this talk I will introduce our IoT infrastructure, software architecture, how we use python and how we plan to improve the capabilities of our farms by adding edge machine learning.
